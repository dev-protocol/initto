Hi, I’m aggre.

Dev Protocol is “a protocol” built for Ethereum. It is a “system substituting for donation” to create a monetizing opportunity for open assets in OSS, Open Access, etc. It’s neither a platform nor a service, but “a protocol”. As you may see, we include the word, protocol, for “Dev Protocol”. We normally don’t always make a detailed research on the meaning of names. Plus, unfortunately,  “protocol” is a hard-to-grasp terminology. Therefore, even those who know that every name has its some kind of meaning might be still confused with “protocol”. No worries. The definition of protocol is not so significant. The important thing here is to figure out how different it is from web service. If you could see the difference, you’ll get the picture of Dev Protocol.

## Protocols in existing service


A great start to get the idea of Dev Protocol is to look for a familiar case.

In the modern world of the internet, we see many types of web service using various digital payment for monetization. Most of the service is paid with credit cards, for example, “Alice pays X dollars for Bob”.

A protocol called ISO8583 is used for credit card payment. Since it is a payment via the internet, protocols such as TCP, IP, SSL and TSL are used as well. The money transfer from Alice to Bob is one type of protocol. There are a lot of protocols, but the meaning of each protocol is not so necessary! The fact that web service is composed of a group of protocols is an important point.

Let’s say a person is launching an e-commerce without utilizing any existing protocols. Well, that’s not even an “e” commerce, so it should be like “a new activity to get something from a distant place”. Forgive me for my utmost possible but might be complicated word choice. Anyhow, in it’s service, he/she has to exchange something without using the internet, emails, smoke signals, letters, money, or barter trade. Even if it sounds revolutionary depending on your outlook and set of values, I recommend you not to suggest it to your friends unless they are drunk and stayed up late at midnight.

I think you get some idea on the difference between “web service” and “protocol”.

Web service is composed of the combination of protocols. Web service can only carry its own protocol, but there is almost no advantages for it. Protocols definitely has versatile purposes, so they are used among people sharing the same objectives.

## What’s Dev Protocol used for?

Dev Protocol is a protocol that enables people to have a monetizing opportunity with open assets such as OSS, Open Access, etc. It is a kind of function that replaces arrangements like “Alice pays X dollars for Bob” mentioned in the previous chapter.

The difference between open assets and mugs sold at an online shop is that people cannot receive payment as a compensation for the service of open assets. Creators of them release their assets with good intentions and they have to earn their living from their another source of income. If such creators ask compensation of their users, existence value of the open assets is lost due to the lack of openness. What a paradox!

Conventionally, the biggest chance for monetization that people can rely on with open assets was donation. Donation itself is one of the greatest protocols. However, we thought it inappropriate that open assets rely on a single protocol. That’s why we developed Dev Protocol.

## What can we do with Dev Protocol?

Briefly speaking, it’s like this : “Both Alice and Bob gain an income without money transfer.” Oh, please don’t think that I’ve turned into an enigmatic alien living outside the space.

Well, the income here is not cash but crypto assets called DEV. DEV is inflating slowly, in other words, it increases the total amount of supply gradually. Its new supply is allocated to people depositing DEV and OSS creators. Depositing is usually called “Staking”.

People, who have done staking, receive new supply in addition to DEV that they staked. For example, if the staked DEV is 100%, the total DEV with new supply becomes 120%. OSS creators receive the new supply of DEV in proportion to the number of staking that they’ve obtained.

Let me organize what I’ve talked to you so far in the next chapter.

## Who uses Dev Protocol?


There are 3 types of people.


1. Authors
2. Patrons
3. Maintainers

Their description is as follows:

**Authors**
Authors do activities that are subject to patrons’ support. Open source developers, researchers and creators are categorized as such people. Authors gain owner reward in proportion to the obtained number of staking.

**Patrons**
Patrons do staking in order to support authors’ activities. Patrons gain staking reward in return for supporting authors.

**Maintainers**
Maintainers develop Market, a scheme authenticating authors’ activities, and improve the core of Dev Protocol.

## Are we Dev Protocol?


I think you’ve already noticed that protocols are not developed by certain companies, as I touched on it in the previous chapter. The internet is never composed of only one company.

Dev Protocol is maintained by Frame00, a Japanese company, currently. However, its maintenance authority is going to be lost little by little in the process of “decentralization”, which would take 6 months to 1 year and a half.

As long as Dev Protocol is a protocol, it’s an existence like the internet (TCP/IP) or SSL/TSL, so it shouldn’t be developed for sales by a single commercial company.

## Maintenance without administrators


Our idea is that a system maintained by people meeting and parting based on incentives is more sustainable in terms of neutrality and permanence, rather than a maintenance system that relies on a legal body.

The reason why we adopted Ethereum as the basis for Dev Protocol is the same. Since Ethereum is one of the decentralized computing, it runs without administrators.

That means, in case we’re all run over by a bus, Dev Protocol continues to operate normally. When it comes to the adequacy of a protocol, such function should be required.

## What can developers do?

To conclude, Dev Protocol is not a web service but a protocol.

If you want to accomplish something on the internet, Dev Protocol can be one of your choices as a tool.

You can also create monetizing service on the web for users such as Authors and Patrons. There is no need to pay commission for the protocol, and no restriction like API limit. You can work as a Maintainer to develop a protocol itself. There aren’t so many codes required.

It would be our greatest pleasure if[documents on Dev Protocol](https://docs.devprotocol.xyz/dev-protocol/)could be informative for you.

For those who want to know more about Dev Protocol, I’m preparing an article about decentralized protocols for my next entry.
