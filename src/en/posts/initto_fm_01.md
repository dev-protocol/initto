## Whatâ€™s INITTO FM?
In INITTO FM, we invite OSS developers joining Stakes.social as guest speakers, introduce them, and talk about OSS with them. The moderator for this program is Kawakami.

## Guest speaker
We welcomed hhatto as our very first guest.
hhatto is developing autopep8, which is a well-known code format tool for Phython.

### [How did hhatto know Dev Protocol?](https://youtu.be/BgPjQGlSLZs?t=859) 14:19
I heard about Dev Protocol around three years ago when it has just started tokenizing projects of npm.

### [OSS registered at Stakes.Social](https://youtu.be/BgPjQGlSLZs?t=1005) 16:45
I register an OSS called autopep8 at Stakes.Social. This OSS is a code format tool for Phytho, and Iâ€™ve been developing it for 10 years. Now Iâ€™m doing my best to develop its Version 2.0. It would be a major update, and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll like it. You can check the situation of 2.0 in this [blog post](https://www.hexacosa.net/blog/detail/194/).

### [What hhatto is expecting for Dev Protocol](https://youtu.be/BgPjQGlSLZs?t=1612) 26:52
I think only a few people know of Dev Protocol. It is a fantastic framework, so I hope more creators can get an idea of it. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing the increasing number of registered projects as well as the expansion of support for Dev Protocol.

### [Messages for supporters](https://youtu.be/BgPjQGlSLZs?t=1660) 27:40
I really appreciate for your continuous support. Your support onwards will be an enormous help and I want to express my deepest gratitude for it. Meanwhile, Iâ€™d like you, my supporters, to oversee my activities. If there is a case where you think they arenâ€™t worthy enough to provide any value, please feel free to change your staking to the other project. I think thatâ€™s more sensible and practical.

## To be continued
Weâ€™ll go on with the broadcast with guest speakers of OSS developers. There is more to come for INITTO FM.
